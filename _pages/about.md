<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently working toward the Ph.D degree at the School of Computer Science and Technology, **[Beijing Institute of Technology](https://www.bit.edu.cn/)**, under the supervision of **[Prof. Hui Liu](https://liuhuigmail.github.io/)**. I also obtained Master‚Äôs degree at Jiangsu University, under the supervision of **[Prof. Jinfu Chen](https://cs.ujs.edu.cn/info/1508/30277.htm)**.

My research interest includes **Software Refactoring**, **Software Evolution**, and **LLM for SE**. I have published at the top international SE conferences/journals such as **ESEC/FSE**, **ASE**, and **TSE**.  I developed a few well-known approaches including:

- **[ReExtractor](https://github.com/lyoubo/ReExtractor)**: refactoring detection
- **[ReMapper](https://github.com/lyoubo/ReMapper)**: code entity matching
- **[feTruth](https://github.com/lyoubo/feTruth)**: feature envy detection (Sponsored by **[Huawei](https://bbs.huaweicloud.com/blogs/416188?utm_source=zhihu&utm_medium=bbs-ex&utm_campaign=other&utm_content=content)**)
